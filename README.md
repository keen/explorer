### How to use Explorer on your site or in your app

##### Option 1: Use the hosted assets from our CDN

```html
<!-- Dependencies -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.5/css/bootstrap.min.css">
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.1.3/jquery.min.js"></script>

<!-- Explorer Assets -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://d26b395fwzu5fz.cloudfront.net/apps/keen-explorer-4.0.3.min.css">
<script src="https://d26b395fwzu5fz.cloudfront.net/apps/keen-explorer-4.0.3.bundle.min.js"></script>
```

##### Option 2: Include the files yourself

You'd need to include all of the same assets as those listed in the CDN example above. You can [download the Explorer source code](https://github.com/keen/explorer/archive/master.zip) to get the `keen-explorer.js` and `keen-explorer.css` files (as well as the minified versions). And you can choose to include jQuery and Bootstrap however you wish, from CDNs or using downloaded copies.

##### Option 3: Install using NPM

This is as easy as `npm install keen-explorer`

#### Get your project ID & API keys

If you havenâ€™t done so already, [login to Keen IO to create a project](https://keen.io/add-project) for your app. You'll need a [Keen IO account](https://keen.io/signup?s=explorer) to create a project. The Project ID and API Keys are available on the Project Overview page. You will need these for the next steps.

#### Initialize the app

Somewhere on the page that you want to show Explorer you'll need to configure a Keen.js client and pass that into the initialization of a new Explorer. Here's how you do it:

```html
<div id="keen-explorer"></div>
<script>
  const myExplorer = new KeenExplorer('#keen-explorer')
    .client({
      projectId: 'PROJECT_ID',
      readKey: 'READ_KEY'
    })
    .persistence(true)
    .fetch();
</script>
```

And that's it. You're done!

## Custom builds of the Explorer

  1. Clone our repo `git clone https://github.com/keen/explorer.git`
  2. Configure the Keen.js client in the demo file at test/demo/demo-config.js with your project ID and Keen IO API keys.
  3. Install the dependencies with `npm install`.
  4. Run the development script with `npm run start`.
  5. You can now view the demo locally at `http://localhost:8080/` or your specified port.

```markdown

## What does this PR do? How does it affect users?

## How should this be tested?

Step through the code line by line. Things to keep in mind as you review:
 - Are there any edge cases not covered by this code?
 - Does this code follow conventions (naming, formatting, modularization, etc) where applicable?

Fetch the branch and/or deploy to staging to test the following:

- [ ] Does the code compile without warnings (check shell, console)?
- [ ] Do all tests pass?
- [ ] Does the UI, pixel by pixel, look exactly as expected (check various screen sizes, including mobile)?
- [ ] If the feature makes requests from the browser, inspect them in the Web Inspector. Do they look as expected (parameters, headers, etc)?
- [ ] If the feature sends data to Keen, is the data visible in the project if you run an extraction (include link to collection/query)?
- [ ] If the feature saves data to a database, can you confirm the data is indeed created in the database?
